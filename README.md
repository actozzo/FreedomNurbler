# FreedomNurbler
Inspired by this SMBC comic: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2779

This is very much tongue-in-cheek, perhaps even, tongue-through-cheek.

Original nurbler replaces everything but nouns to 'nurble'. 

Freedom nurbler replaces verbs with a patriotic verb such as 'liberate' or 'defend'. Define a list of verbs in another text file. Originally, verbs had a ~10% chance of being replaced. Then I increased the threshold to 40% and it was still funny. So I've removed that threshold completely and every verb will be replaced with a verb from the 'chosen' list.
