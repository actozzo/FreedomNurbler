# FreedomNurbler
Inspired by this SMBC comic: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2779

Original nurbler replaces everything but nouns to 'nurble'. 

Freedom nurbler replaces random verbs (set some threshold like 10%) with a patriotic verb such as 'liberate' or 'defend'. Define a list of verbs in another text file.
